UniformsUtils
Provides utility functions for managing uniforms.

Methods
.clone ( src : Object ) : Object
src -- An object representing uniform definitions.

Clones the given uniform definitions by performing a deep-copy. That means if the value of a uniform refers to an object like a Vector3 or Texture, the cloned uniform will refer to a new object reference.

.merge ( uniforms : Array ) : Object
uniforms -- An array of objects containing uniform definitions.

Merges the given uniform definitions into a single object. Since the method internally uses .clone(), it performs a deep-copy when producing the merged uniform definitions.
